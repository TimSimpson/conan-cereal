# conan-cereal
Conan (https://conan.io) package for C++ library Cereal (https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal)

# Version Number Schema

I'm trying to match the number of cereal, plus an extra number seperated by a
dash which represents any changes to the package I've had to make (b/c in
theory there may be multiple packages for each official release of Cereal).

# Credit

Nearly all of this was stolen from Memsharded's spdlog Conan file, but please
note that all mistakes and imperfections from the duplication are copyrighted
by me.

example.cpp, used to test the Conan package, is blatantly stolen from the Cereal
repo's README file.

The author of this Conan package has no relation to the Cereal library authors.
